A repository dedicated to implementations of algorithms of number-theoretic cryptography methods studied at LETI in 2022.

In this repository there is a base folder, which implements the basic algorithms used in more complex algorithms that lie outside the base folder.

The course was devoted to arithmetic of residuals, solving linear, exponential and power comparisons modulo prime and composite numbers, as well as solving comparisons modulo a polynomial, discrete logarithm and factorization of numbers, and also touched on the elliptic curve, also used in cryptographic protocols.
